Project Documentation
By Kia Yang and Brett Fujioka
This program is meant to simulate a facility maintenance and inspection log for a university. This
program takes into consideration that there are multiple facilities or buildings and that each contains multiple rooms.
Each room and facility is unique, ergo each of them possesses unique identifiers. Likewise, there are many maintenance
workers,managers, and inspectors each possess unique identifiers. Each facility is assigned a manager.
The lists each collect the data from their respective classes and call information from one another. For instance, the
list for facilities will  assign room numbers and room id numbers in a separate list. Likewise, the maintenance
log, requests, and schedule will collect a lists of which worker or inspector is designated certain tasks on certain
dates for specified roles. The model generates and retrieves information from a Database. This assignment, however,
doesn't provide its own data table, but assumes that there is one.
